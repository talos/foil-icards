Hi Mr. Appel,

When we spoke last week you asked for examples of the image degradation from
compression I found in the documents I received versus what is on HPDOnline.

I am providing links to four separate properties that demonstrate this
degradation.  All properties on the drive provided in the FOIL dump were
subject to similar compression and degradation; this is just a sample of ones
I had already managed to download from HPDOnline.

For all of the properties below, I think it is evident that the handwriting is
mostly illegible on the FOIL versions, and almost entirely legible in the
HPDOnline versions.  The differing file sizes suggest a compression ratio of
about 20x, which means the images supplied on the flash stick for the FOIL were
about one twentieth the file size as what can be downloaded from HPDOnline.

* 373 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn

What was on the flash drive was 141KB:

What was on HPDOnline was 2.8MB:

What was on the flash drive was 143KB:

What was on the flash drive was 183KB:

What was on HPDOnline was 3.5MB:

* 146 Fenimore, Brooklyn

What was on the flash drive was 153KB:

https://github.com/talos/foil-icards/blob/gh-pages/foil_691501_146_fenimore.pdf

What was on HPDOnline was 3.1MB:

In addition, the I-Cards supplied on the flash drive did not include metadata
about how to link the I-Card to the appropriate BBL.  I was able to do so for
the above files since I downloaded them from HPDOnline separately, but the
I-Card nubmering scheme does not match any city property identification scheme
I am aware of.  In order to use these files, I would need a mapping, preferably
as a CSV, specifying the applicable BBL for each I-Card's number.

The supplied files were about 40GB.  Extrapolating from the 20x compression
ratio, the uncompressed files should be on the order of 800GB.  There are
new commodity 1TB hard drives available for less than $60 on Amazon:

If a 1TB drive is not big enough, there are also 1.5TB drives available for
only slightly more money:

http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-1-5TB-Portable-External-STBX1500401/dp/B00R49FAZK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1438290740&sr=8-1&keywords=1.5+tb+hard+drive

I am happy to provide additional funds for such a drive, or even to purchase
and have it shipped in original packaging directly to the office of your
choice.

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or have any questions
at all.

Thank you,
-John Krauss
